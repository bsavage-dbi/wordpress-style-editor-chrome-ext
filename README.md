Wordpress Style Editor
=========================================

A chrome extension which enables you to save CSS modifications 
made in developer tools, directly to the Wordpress theme stylesheet.

It works by taking advantage of the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_Files#Using_the_Theme_Editor_and_Plugin_Editor">theme-editor</a> built into wordpress, to 
push CSS changes via ajax. Currently the extension only works on the style.css file located in the theme root directory. 
This is due to <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6531">limitations within Wordpress<a/>.

Download directly from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordpress-style-editor/bgdpllcnhcmpfcheafdhimpklhjoommn?hl=en-US&gl=US" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>.
